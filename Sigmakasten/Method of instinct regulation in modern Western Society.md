### Development and instinct regulation paradox 
Despite that western society has the highest level of technical and humanitarian progress they have huge problem with instinct regulation. All of the mechanisms of harmful for society behavior avoidance are ether personality suppressing (school), partially destroyed (law system, because laws are made to enforce behavior set in religion and without it they are not so efficient) or completely destroyed (religion).

### Threat of instincts to western society
As I said, there are no efficient method of instinct regulation in western society. And if no will appear in short time, western civilization can collapse. Why?  In order to make civilization thrive people have to build complex hierarchies and work for society, but complex hierarchies is impossible to build with people with unregulated instincts. And those instincts are egoistic and destructive (there is instinct for theft (envy) or when to man decide who is higher in hierarchy they can kill each other because there is no instinct that will limit damage brought to other man because in paleolithic period we cant bring too much damage to others we had no claws etc.). So, without an efficient mechanism of instinct regulation our society will just fall apart into lots of small tribes under the instinct pressure.

### Possible ways of situation development
Now western society has to ways ether fell apart or find new mechanism of emotional regulation

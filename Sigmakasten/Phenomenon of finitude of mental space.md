### Introduction

There is an amount of information/stimulation that brain can tolerate without any negative consequences and if it will be exceeded,  brain will tune sensitivity down, in order to avoid over-stimulation and exhaustion. Therefore amount of information, that we consume and remember every day is finite and has to be used sensibly.  
### Trap of over-consuming information

If you consume too much information on daily basis, your brain will lose ability to remember and to process it (simply to think) because your brain will be:
1. Exhausted
2. Tune sensitivity to new information down to the ground
Moreover you may become addicted to information you abuse (eg. social media addiction, gaming addiction) that will keep you in this brain-fog state.

### Impact of your environment on your intellectual work

Contact with people can be really useful for your work, because it will give you new ideas and perspectives in your subject, but it happens only if people in your environment are smart and ambitious, but if your environment is toxic and passive, you will only spend your energy and receive negative emotions in return.
